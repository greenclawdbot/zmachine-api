This package implements an API for the core behaviors of a Z-Machine interpreter

It aims to support Z-Machine games of versions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 (i.e. all but version 6)
as described in the Z-Machine Standards Document version 1.1
https://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point1/index.html

A full interpreter would add screen rendering, keyboard input, sound, and file access components
to this core to produce a playable interpreter. See this link from the future as an example:

This package is a hobby project for me, so I shouldn't promise too much regarding bug fixes and feature requests,
but in general I'd love to hear about what is and is not working for you
